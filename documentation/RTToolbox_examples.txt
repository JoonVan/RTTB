\page Examples Examples
For a quick start, look into testing/examples. There you find the following projects:

- \c RTBioModelExampleTest: Computation of Biological model indices (TCP/NTCP) from a given DVH
- \c RTDoseIndexTest: Computation of dose indices (Conformation Number, Conformal Index, Conformity index) from a given DVH
- \c RTDoseStatisticsDicomTest: Computation of dose statistics (max dose/mean dose/min dose/Dx/Vx) based on dose data for a specified structure
- \c RTDVHTest: Computation of statistics (max value/mean value/min value/Dx/Vx) based on a DVH

DVH Calculation (testing/core):
- \c DVHCalculatorTest: Computation of a DVH from dose and structure

Voxelization (testing/validation):
- \c VoxelizationValidationTest: Computation of a voxelization

Image saving (testing/io/itk):
- \c ITKDoseAccessorConverterTest: Saving image RTToolbox image data as an ITK file
