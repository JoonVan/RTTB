/** \mainpage RTToolbox - DKFZ radiotherapy quantitative evaluation library
\section intro Introduction

Welcome to RTToolbox.\n\n

Radiotherapy is a comprehensive and fast-moving discipline which plays a major role
in cancer care. Software tools which support and simplify the quantitative evaluation
process of radiotherapy are essential to support decision makings and improve therapy
effectiveness.\n
RTToolbox is a software library to support quantitative analysis of treatment outcome
for radiotherapy.\n\n

The RTToolbox was designed following object-oriented design (OOD) principles and was
implemented in the language C++. It supports the import of radiotherapy data (e.g. dose
distributions and structure sets) from DICOM-RT format by using the open source library DCMTK.\n\n

The RTToolbox supports the full range of radiotherapy evaluation.
Tools such as <b>DVH calculation</b>, <b>arithmetic operations on dose distributions</b> and
<b>structure relationship analyses</b> (e.g. fully-contained, partially-contained)
are provided as a basis for further calculations. <b>Dose comparison indices</b> such as
Conformity Index (CI), Homogeneity Index (HI) and Conformation Number (CN),
and biological models including TCP, NTCP, EUD and BED are determined from dose
distributions and DVHs. The RTToolbox can be easily extended to support other
data format, comparison indices and models. Thus, using the RTToolbox
radiotherapy evaluation applications can be built easily and quickly.

\section Build
See readme.txt for building instructions and dependent libraries.\n
Currently, RTToolbox is tested with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2013 and GCC 4.6.

\section Examples
For a quick start, look into the examples directory that is located in testing\examples. There you find the following projects:
<ul>
<li>\b DVHCalculatorExampleTest: Computation of DVH based on dose data for a specified structure
<li>\b RTBioModelExampleTest: Computation of Biological model indices (TCP/NTCP) from a given DVH
<li>\b RTDoseIndexTest: Computation of dose indices (Conformation Number, Conformal Index, Conformity index) from a given DVH
<li>\b RTDoseStatisticsTest: Computation of dose statistics (max dose/mean dose/min dose/Dx/Vx) based on dose data for a specified structure
<li>\b RTDVHTest: Computation of statistics (max value/mean value/min value/Dx/Vx) based on a DVH
</ul>

\section Structure
The RTToolbox code is divided into topic related directories:
<UL>
<LI>\b code: all code for RT data evaluation.
<UL>
<LI> \b core: The main code of the RTToolbox. It includes all interface classes, the main objects used and the DVH 
calculation.</LI>
<LI> \b algorithm: contains the code for dose statistics and dose arithmetics.</LI>
<LI> \b indices: The code for dose comparison indices can be found here.</LI>
<LI> \b interpolation: contains code for dose mapping (transform dose information into another geometry)</LI>
<LI> \b io: Contains sub folders for different formats.</LI>
<UL>
<LI> \b dicom: Support for reading dicom format files (DCMTK is required).</LI>
<LI> \b itk: Support for reading and writing various image formats, e.g. into DoseAccessors (ITK is required).</LI>
<LI> \b helax: Support for reading helax dicom format files.</LI>
<LI> \b other: Reading and writing data from text and XML based formats, e.g. for DoseStatistics.</LI>
</UL>
<LI> \b masks: Here the code for the original toolbox voxelization and the new boost voxelization can be found. This directory includes some 
legacy code required by the legacy voxelization, that should not be used elsewhere. Please use the 
data objects and interfaces defined in 'core'.</LI>
<LI> \b models: It contains the code for the calculation of TCP and NTCP models.</LI>
</UL>
<LI> \b testing: In this directory unit tests (similar 
folder structure as in code) and more extensive tests can be found.</LI>
<LI> \b utilities: This folder contains third party projects needed to build RTToolbox (depending on the activated modules).</LI>
</UL>
