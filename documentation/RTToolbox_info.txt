\section intro Introduction

<b>Radiotherapy</b> is a comprehensive and fast-moving discipline which plays a major role in cancer care. Software tools which support and simplify the quantitative evaluation process of radiotherapy are essential to support decision makings and improve therapy effectiveness.\n\n
RTToolbox is a software library to support quantitative analysis of treatment outcome for radiotherapy.\n\n

The RTToolbox was designed following object-oriented design (OOD) principles and was implemented in the language C++. It supports the import of radiotherapy data (e.g. dose distributions and structure sets) from DICOM-RT format and other standard image processing formats by using a bridge to ITK.\n\n

The RTToolbox supports the full range of radiotherapy evaluation. Tools such as <b>DVH calculation</b>, <b>Dose statistic calculation</b>, <b>arithmetic operations on dose distributions</b> and <b>structure relationship analyses</b> (e.g. fully-contained, partially-contained) are provided as a basis for further calculations. <b>Dose comparison indices</b> such as Conformity Index (CI), Homogeneity Index (HI) and Conformation Number (CN), and biological models including TCP, NTCP, EUD and BED are determined from dose distributions and DVHs. The RTToolbox can be easily extended to support other data format, comparison indices and models. Thus, using the RTToolbox radiotherapy evaluation applications can be built easily and quickly.

Also, the RTToolbox provides some <b>apps</b> e.g. for DVH/Dose Statistic calculation or Dose accumulation that provides a convenient access of RT scenarios without computer-science knowledge.
