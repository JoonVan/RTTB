/** \mainpage RTToolbox - DKFZ radiotherapy quantitative evaluation library
\section intro Introduction

Welcome to RTToolbox ...\n\n

Radiotherapy is a comprehensive and fast-moving discipline which plays a major role
in cancer care. Software tools which support and simplify the quantitative evaluation
process of radiotherapy are essential to support decision makings and improve therapy
effectiveness.\n
RTToolbox is a software library to support quantitative analysis of treatment outcome
for radiotherapy.\n\n

The RTToolbox was designed following object-oriented design (OOD) principles and was
implemented in the language C++. It supports the import of radiotherapy data (e.g. dose
distributions and structure sets) from arbitrary format (e.g. stored in DICOM-RT
standard format using the open source library DCMTK).\n\n

The RTToolbox supports the full range of radiotherapy evaluation.
Tools such as DVH calculation, arithmetic operations on dose distributions and
structure relationship analysis (e.g. fully-contained, partially-contained)
are provided as a basis for further calculations. Dose comparison indices such as
Conformity Index (CI), Homogeneity Index (HI) and Conformation Number (CN),
and biological models including TCP, NTCP, EUD and BED are determined from dose
distributions and DVHs. The RTToolbox can be easily extended to support other
data format, comparison indices and models. A PostgreSQL database was designed
to store study information and analysis results. The communication interfaces
between toolbox and database are provided as well. Thus, using the RTToolbox
radiotherapy evaluation applications can be built easily and quickly.

\section Structure
The RTToolbox code is contained in topic related folders:
<UL>
<LI>\b code: you will find all relevant code for RT data evaluation.
<UL>
<LI> \b core: The main code of the RTToolbox. Here you'll find all interface classes, the main objects used and the DVH 
calculation.</LI>
<LI> \b algorithm: Here you find the code for dose statistics.</LI>
<LI> \b indices: The code for dose comparison indices can be found here.</LI>
<LI> \b io: Containes sub folderes for different formats.</LI>
<UL>
<LI> \b dicom: Support for the dicom format (You need DCMTK to build this option).</LI>
<LI> \b other: Data from text formats.</LI>
</UL>
<LI> \b masks: Here you can find the code for the original toolbox voxelisation. We are currently 
re-designing the atructure of the RT-Toolbox, therefore this folder also includes some 
legacy code required by this voxelization, that should not be used elsewhere. Please use the 
data objects and interfaces defined in 'core'.</LI>
<LI> \b models: It contains the code for the calculation of TCP and NTCP models.</LI>
</UL>
<LI> \b testing: In this folder you find corresponding unit tests (similar 
folder structure as in code) and more extensive tests, which use multiple classes in 'examples'.</LI>
<LI> \b utilities: This folder contains third party projects needed to build RTToolbox (depending on the activated modules).</LI>
</UL>
